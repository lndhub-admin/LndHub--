# LndHub-PlusMinus
This is a forked BlueWallet LndHub with changes to buildsystem and deploy aimed at single instance LndHub to LND.

It is to be deployed without adjustments to mimic the environment with "adds" that BlueWallet LndHub repo has expectations of,
thus make it a simpler more effective deploy from get Go.

Added are the LndHub-Admin-Extension + component folder, that acts as a example of how-to extend LndHub without need change to core src.

LndHub+- is the base layer for the LndHub-Admin Toolbox.
